# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This file holds the controller configurations for the arm controllars
# on the robot.
# 
# These are loaded into the controller layer by the  controller
# manager at will, and the joints they describe need to match the hardware
# layer
# 
# The controller manager handles the upper level logic, and makes sure
# the controllers do not conflict
# 
# Here is the benefit of having these controllers on the robot:
# 
# For one thing, these are PID controllers. Each controller has hand-calibrated
# PID parameters attached to it, and these are used e.g. to maintain the robot 
# in a certain position. 
# 
# Another thing these controllers do is implement a standard interface, as 
# described by ros_control package. Other packages like MoveIt make use of 
# these controllers to move the robot.
# 
# USAGE
# To move the robot using these controllers, send the expected type of message
# (e.g. a JointTrajectory message for a JointTrajectoryController) to the 
# "/[controller name]/command" topic. See arm_manipulator.cpp for an example.
